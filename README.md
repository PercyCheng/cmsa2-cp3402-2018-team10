WPSiteSync for Content - https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsitesynccontent/

For continued development, the latest wp-content folder may be downloaded from the latest commit by forking this repository.

In terms of the publishing wortkflow, the following procedure was used:

#Local Development Environment
Scotchbox (https://box.scotch.io/) environment that requires vagrant and virtualbox installs to develop environment.
The following resources from Scotch School (https://scotch.io/courses/getting-started-with-scotch-box-vagrant-for-the-absolute-beginner/a-quick-explanation) were then used to further connect the database and WordPress into the development environment.

GitHub commits were performed and merging branches were created continuously in order to develop gradually amongst a team project environment.

#Staging
In order to move content and database to staging, the plugin primarily used was All in One Migration WP to transfer a large amount of content onto the staging server altogether.  But further on development, WPSiteSync was used to upload single pages to the staging server.

#Production
After marking the product as a release on GitHub, using All in One, the entire site was then copied to production to be run immeadiately.
